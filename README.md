# PHSX815_Week2-repository
This repository is for the HW assigned in PHSX 815 during week 2

## HW 4
The folder HW 4 contains the python folder with all the python code files that were used in the completion of HW 4. These include the modified CookieAnalysis.py, CookieTimer.py, Random.py, MySort.py, randomnums.txt, and the plot figure file.


### CookieTimer.py
File Created by Dr. Rogan. Creates a list of random numbers. These numbers are saved to a .txt file. Other files depend on the output of this class.

### MySort.py
Class file created by Dr. Rogan. This class has several sorting algorithms that other code is able to select to use to sort their lists.

### CookieAnalysis.py
Originally coded by Dr. Rogan. This code originally takes in a list of random numbers and uses the MySort.py class to sort the numbers. This code was modified to to see how long long it took various sorting methods. This was later commented out to pursue the true objective of the assignment. Code was added to create a histogram out of the sorted random numbers. Additionally, vertical lines were added to show where the mean, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles. 

### randomnums.txt
Contains the list of random numbers generated by CookieTimer.py

### *.tif
Any of the .tif files are the histograms created by running this code.

## HW 3
The files for HW 3 are contained in the file HW3. This includes Random.py and other files

### Random.py
This is the file where I implemented my own random number distribution. 

Here is the plot that was made of the distribtuion run from windows but not from terminal. ![image not found](Figure 2023-01-27 234236.jpg)
